# 🔥 FireDucks vs Pandas - Speed Battle on Big Data!

Welcome to a performance face-off between two powerhouse Python libraries — **Pandas** 🐼 and **FireDucks** 🔥🦆 — to see who reigns supreme when working with **10 million+ row datasets**! 🚀

We benchmarked both libraries using **realistic data operations** that are common in any analytics or data engineering workflow.

---

## ✨ What’s Inside?

We tested both libraries with a **synthetic dataset of 10 million rows** 📄 and performed the following operations:

- 📂 **Read Large CSV Files & Filter Data**
- 🔁 **GroupBy Operations**
- 🔃 **Sorting Data**
- ⏱️ **Benchmark Runtime Comparison**

All examples are clean, simple, and reflect **real-world data tasks** 💼

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Python 3.x** 🐍 – Core language  
- **Pandas** 🐼 – The baseline data manipulation library  
- **FireDucks** 🔥🦆 – Compiler-accelerated, multi-threaded Pandas alternative  
- **Matplotlib** 📊 – For plotting performance comparisons
